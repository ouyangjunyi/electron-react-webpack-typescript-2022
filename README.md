# ERWT - Electron React Webpack Typescript (Minimal)

ERWT is a minimal secure boilerplate for writing Desktop Applications using [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) & [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). <br /> This project makes use of latest packages and configurations to serve the best environment for development.

<br>

ðŸ“¢  This minimal version comes without `electron-window` integration, no custom window - titlebar - menus etc.

<br>

Install dependencies using [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) or [yarn](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yarn) or [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) :

```bash
# using pnpm
pnpm install

# or using yarn
yarn install

# or using npm
npm install
```

<br />

## Start : Development

To develop and run your application, you need to run following command.
<br />
Start electron application for development :

```bash
yarn start
```

<br />

## Lint : Development

To lint application source code using ESLint via this command :

yarn lint
```

<br />

## Package : Production

Customize and package your Electron app with OS-specific bundles (.app, .exe etc)

```

<br />

## Make : Production

Making is a way of taking your packaged application and making platform specific distributables like DMG, EXE, or Flatpak files (amongst others).

```bash
yarn make
```

<br />

## Publish : Production

Publishing is a way of taking the artifacts generated by the `make` command and sending them to a service somewhere for you to distribute or use as updates. (This could be your update server or an S3 bucket)

```bash
yarn publish
```

<br />

## Packager & Makers Configuration
